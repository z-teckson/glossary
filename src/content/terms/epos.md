# Epos

**Definition**: Epic poetry; a long narrative poem, often about heroic deeds.

**Etymology**: Greek ἔπος (épos) meaning "word, song, tale". Derived from Proto-Indo-European *wekʷ- ("to speak").

**Historical Usage**: In ancient Greek literature, epos referred specifically to hexameter verse recounting heroic legends, such as the Homeric epics.

**Modern Usage**: The term has broadened in literary studies to encompass any grand narrative or cycle of myths across cultures, not limited to Greek hexameter.

**Comparison**: While ancient Greek epos was tightly bound to metrical form and heroic subject matter, contemporary usage embraces a wider range of epic traditions, including oral and written forms from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
